React + Typescript + SOLID

## Getting Started

In order to use the application, first run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the necessary libraries.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
It will automatically open in your browser.

### `npm run test`

Runs the tests.

# Notes

I've created the app using `create-react-app`, used TypeScript, SCSS modules, axios and applied SOLID principles. For testing purposes I've used React-Testing-Library & Jest.
You will encounter some `// todo ` notes that I've left on purpose to show what features I'd like to add in the future :)
